# hello-world

Welcome to my IdeaPad on GitHub. 

Daniel here. I am excited to be on this journey. I am new to coding (and GitHub).I am excited to be here learning, collaborating, and building with others. Someday (soon), I'd like to build a software company that creates simple, yet effective products aimed to help bring entrepreneurship closer to individuals with a passion. At this point, I only know HTML. I recently started learning Python. It all feels really big somedays. Somedays it feels like it's much bigger than me. But the truth is practice, intent and consistency, birth the riches of our desires. One day soon I will be looking back at this post from the other side of the bridge. I feel myself. 1-26-21
